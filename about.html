                <p class="section-content">
                    My journey into project management started with a background in culinary arts and technology. As a chef and kitchen manager, I developed a passion for leading teams, optimizing workflows, and managing high-pressure environments. These skills naturally transitioned into project management, where I now apply the same level of discipline and leadership to tech-driven projects.

                <p class="section-content">
                    Currently, I’m pursuing a bachelor’s degree in computer science, further strengthening my ability to manage complex technology projects and align them with business goals. My experience in both fields allows me to blend technical expertise with practical business solutions, ensuring smooth project delivery from start to finish.

            <h2 class="section-title">Hobbies & Interests</h2>
            <p class="section-content">
                Outside of project management, I am deeply passionate about martial arts, particularly Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and Muay Thai, which keep me both mentally and physically sharp. I also enjoy spending time with my dog, staying active outdoors, and exploring new culinary techniques. My interests in tech continue to grow, as I regularly challenge myself with side projects and coding exercises to further develop my technical skills.
